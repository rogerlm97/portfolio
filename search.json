    "text": "Clouds are the main enemy in Earth Observation form space, specifically in the visible and infrared spectrum. In tropical latitudes, clouds can block the surface vision from Remote Sensing satellites during whole seasons, making the use of imagery useless. As blowing away the clouds of a whole continent would be a bit of an extreme solution, It is important to automatically flag all pixels contaminated by clouds to inform about the low quality of image and raise caution when using them for analysis.\nYou can access the code in GitHub Here."

Development of algorithms, platforms and Software dedicated to the use of this frameworks has largely enriched its possibilities. Nevertheless, the user still has to process data in the proper way to avoid getting to flawed conclusions. The process can be challenging, although the huge GeoSpatial community, mainly working in OpenSource, is of great value when struggling with data processing."

This datasets provide World coverage Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a remote sensing based Index to retrieve the level of photosynthesizing activity of the Earth surface. Once selected, the code applies the anomaly z-score metric and displays the results in the map viewer.\n\n\n\nUser interface.\n\n\nBy clicking at any spot in the map, you can explore the Vegetation Index value through the whole time-series. By doing so, you can explore the seasonal rhythm of each habitat, the growth period, senescence begins, possible drought, forest fire, or other perturbations that have affected the surface productivity, and life living on it."

    "text": "What can I use it for?\nGood point. Let‚Äôs get back to the main question. Where do animals move to?\nAs you might figure, food is one of the main reasons animals displace large distances. Vegetation resources are a key element for many herbivores, but also for carnivores feeding on them. While movements are timed to Earth rotation and solar incidence, regional disturbances can alter the seasonal average vegetation production, causing either a resource decay or a surplus, and cascading to animal biodiversity abundance with population bottlenecks or outbreaks."
